## What is this repository for?

This repository hosts the scripts and files for generating a R library that provides functions for morphometric conversions for the IOTC species and pelagic sharks caught in tuna and tuna-like fisheries.

## How to build the artifacts

-  The source parameters for the conversions are included in the XLSX spreadsheet [IOTC_DETERMINISTIC_EQUATIONS.xlsx](./data-raw/IOTC_DETERMINISTIC_EQUATIONS.xlsx)
-   Run the `00.run.R` script and wait for its completion
